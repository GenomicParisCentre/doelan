    <section name="How do I commit a bug report?">

<!--    <section name="How do I get access to the CVS?">
      <p>The Doelan project uses the CVS system to develop the core parts of the software. Due to security reasons, we cannot open freely this cvs server to external users of the ENS. So if you want contribute to the core of Doelan, you can send patches to the developer using the developers <a href="mail-lists.html">mailing-list</a>.</p>
