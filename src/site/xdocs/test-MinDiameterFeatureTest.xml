      <subsection>
      
        <p>The aim of this test is to reject all spots with a too small diameter. This Doelan test use the Genepix <b>Dia.</b> column of the GPR or the ImaGene <b>Diameter</b> column.</p>

      <subsection name="Parameters">
      
        <ul>
          <li><b>Minimal diameter value</b>: The minimal value of the diameter in micrometer for a spot to be not excluded.</li>
          <li><b>Maximal threshold of bad spots</b>: The threshold in percent of invalid spots to reject the test. In the count, empty and abscent spots aren't considered.</li>
          <li><b>Remove bad spot from the output list</b>: If enabled, spots which don't pass the test will be removed in output arraylist file.</li>
        </ul>
        
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Graphics">
      
        <p>This test will generate a graphics showing the distribution of diameter of the spots.</p>
