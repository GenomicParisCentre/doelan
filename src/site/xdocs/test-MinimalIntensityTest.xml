    <section name="Minimal Intensity feature test">
    
    <subsection name="Description">
    
    <p>The aim of this test is to reject all spots with a too low intensity. This Doelan test use the 635 foreground intensity (Genepix <b>F635 Median</b> column) and the 532 foreground intensity (Genepix <b>F532 Median</b> column). This test works only woth GPR Files.</p>
    
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection name="Parameters">
    
    <ul>      
      <li><b>Minimal spot intensity</b>: The mininum value of the intensity in each color for a spot to be not excluded.</li>
      <li><b>Channel to test</b>: The channel(s) to test (red, green or both).</li>
      <li><b>Maximal threshold of bad spots</b>: The threshold in percent of invalid spots to reject the test. In the count, empty and abscent spots aren't considered.</li>
      <li><b>Remove bad spot from the output list</b>: If enabled, spots which don't pass the test will be removed in output arraylist file.</li>
    </ul>
    
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection name="Graphics">
    
    <p>This test will generate two graphics (one for each color) showing the distribution of   intensities of the spots.</p>
