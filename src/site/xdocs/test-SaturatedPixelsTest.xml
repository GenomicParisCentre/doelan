    <subsection name="Description">
        
    <p>The aim of this test is to reject all spots with too many saturated pixels. This Doelan test use the percent of 635 foreground intensity (Genepix <b>F635 % Sat.</b> column) and the percent of 635 foreground intensity (Genepix <b>F532 % Sat.</b> column). This test works only woth GPR Files.</p>
    
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection name="Parameters">
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Threshold maximum of saturated pixels</b>: The maximal value in the percent of saturated pixels for a spot to be not excluded.</li>
      <li><b>Maximal threshold of bad spots</b>: The threshold in percent of invalid spots to reject the test. In the count, empty and abscent spots aren't considered.</li>
      <li><b>Remove bad spot from the output list</b>: If enabled, spots which don't pass the test will be removed in output arraylist file.</li>
    </ul>
